## Bigger project outline

The final target is to create a house plant incubator - a cube that would detect which plant was put in, what diseases it has, and introduce a protocol for its treatment. It will have multiple sensors (temperature, humidity, light, etc.) as well as a way of influencing those factors.

## Project: Deep Learning

Regarding the scope of our university "Project: Deep Learning" it would be creating software for this tool. This is setting up the server that the cube would be connected to, programming the Arduino/Raspberry Pi within the cube (if the hardware will be ready by the end of our project), and training the classification algorithms. Regarding the AI:

- training plant classification model based on camera input
- training plant diseases classification model based on camera input

We already found good datasets so the problem should be solvable. Exact information about data sources will be provided later.
